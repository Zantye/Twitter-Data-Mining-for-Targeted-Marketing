# Twitter-Data-Mining-for-Targeted-Marketing

Developed an approach to target users on Twitter by discerning their preferences with the use of unique keywords in the real estate sector. This project consists of multiple stages that extract data from Twitter to collect usernames and carry out further classification and elimination of usernames through different stages to qualify them based on their probability of affording a property in the target regions.

The accounts of qualified usernames are further crawled to find extra contact information to increase the audience reachability. This approach can thus enable organizations to send targeted advertisements to a set of users based on their locations and preferences, thus allowing them to revamp their strategy and enhance their marketing output.
